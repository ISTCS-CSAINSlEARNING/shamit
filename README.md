## shambrain

small python project to simulate 4D fmri data without activation given a BIDS
(or good old OpenfMRI) dataset. Still very much work in progress.

Basic functionality is in shambrain/shambrain.py. Pretty much everything else
is still shambrain material and will be piecewise replaced by our content.
